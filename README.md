The most common version of the game involves the snake or line eating items which make it longer, with the objective being to avoid running into a border or the snake itself for as long as possible.The player loses when the snake either runs into a border or its own body.Because of this, the game becomes more difficult as it goes on, due to the growth of the snake.
Nokia has installed the “Snake Game” on many of its phones. The game is also available on several websites, including YouTube, allowing viewers to play the game while a video load.
